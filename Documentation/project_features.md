## Project Idea (as per june 15, 2020)
Malayalam Audible like site

A website in malayalam, in which people can post there short stories novels, etc both in text and in audible,
Signed user can pay a monthly premium to access it or purchase them even at a lower rates of 10 rupees.\
* Full medium style text editor (get that from your blognotes app)\
* An inbuilt reader option.
* Inbuilt audioplayer for the audiobooks.
* Comments and ratings below each story.
* A dashboard where the content is first uploaded then after meeting quality constrains to store(with django admin, from UB).
and more..\
audible like interface... can set mood to a story(like as in sanchariyude diary kurippukal).. story teller can read the story in a context, plain way can specify the mood at certain points and can select background tones for that point( This will come over to the basic mood selected by user, if no tone is selected, some default tone mood is applied as like)..
first the story is visible in admin panel like user group, from there some one can point any mistakes, so the teller can correct that portion ( need a fully functional audio editor)
on the user side...
after getting certain likes it can be moved(or after certain views or period) to main page user can hear like comment.. to author
but a website will be of no use with these idea, a native app both for creators, and users..


## Design Constrains
---

* Think like when people will read, at night mostly, so design with an in-built night mode, and choose a blue--nightblue color, a combination of nightblue + black for the interface..
* Then think icons as stars, give them a star like color(bright yellow), with readable hand-written style font,
use lobster as a start,
* Use starry light bleeding, and twinkling animations
* moon-window-lady reading a book welcome background.
* (Later can enable a day theme with white + orange, reversing the same idea)
* Use that side nav get from discord


## Prerequisite
---

* Firstly Design a harry potter fullset offer landing page Using that theme, then migrate after..
* Use the bootstrap 5 + custom design for the project, unless it will take great time
* Build at least 2 bootstrap 5 enabled project (at the time of completing the tutorial 2 sessions a day),
* Complete the 21 day responsive course before that..

Do a sample project Involving day + Night theme shifter..
